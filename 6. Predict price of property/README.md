## Predict price of property 

Price of a property is one of the most important decision criteria  when people buy homes. Real estate firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers. Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have, which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties, putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property. This model can then be used to plan future development of properties taking into consideration factors which tend to increase value of property
