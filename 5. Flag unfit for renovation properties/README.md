## Flag unfit for renovation properties

As the real estate becomes a scarce commodity in big cities of the world; renovating old properties for sale is becoming a thriving business. However, not every property becomes an attractive portfolio after tons of time, money and effort goes into giving it a second life.

Reasons can be its location, condition being too dilapidated or simply the neighborhood having lost its luster of the old days. These things are not very difficult to figure out after a thorough assessment. But by the time that assessment is over; a lot of time, manpower and money is lost, which makes the overall endeavor, at times, resulting in crippling loss for this upcoming branch of alternative business opportunity for real estate industry.

Flagging a property as possibly junk beforehand can help businesses prioritize their efforts and focus them on the more probable successes rather than bogged down with the weight of unsaleable portfolio. In this project we will be making use of data from such past operations where many properties were found to be junk after their purchase for renovations. 

**Objective:**  
To build a predictive model for predicting whether a property should be marked as junk on the basis of listing and preliminary assessment details. 

**Target:**  
Build a predictive model for the variable ‘junk’
